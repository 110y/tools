apply suggested fixes

Usage: fix [flags] <filename>

Example: apply suggested fixes for this file:

Â  $ gopls fix -w internal/lsp/cmd/check.go

gopls fix flags are:
  -a	apply all fixes, not just preferred fixes
  -d	display diffs instead of rewriting files
  -w	write result to (source) file instead of stdout
