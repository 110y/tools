## New features

### Integrated documentation viewer

Gopls now offers a "View package documentation" code action that opens
a local web page displaying the generated documentation for the
current Go package in a form similar to https://pkg.go.dev. Use it to
preview the marked-up documentation as you prepare API changes, or to
read the documentation for locally edited packages, even ones that
have not yet been saved. Reload the page after an edit to see updated
documentation.

TODO: demo of VS Code `Source action > View package documentation`.

Clicking on the source-code link associated with a declaration will
cause your editor to navigate to the declaration.

TODO: appeal to VS Code users to upvote https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/208093?

### Hover shows size/offset info

Hovering over the identifier that declares a type or struct field now
displays the size information for the type, and the offset information
for the field. This information may be helpful when making space
optimizations to your data structures, or when reading assembly code.

TODO: example hover image.
