## New features

### Integrated documentation viewer

Gopls now offers a "View package documentation" code action that opens
a local web page displaying the generated documentation for the
current Go package in a form similar to https://pkg.go.dev. Use it to
preview the marked-up documentation as you prepare API changes, or to
read the documentation for locally edited packages, even ones that
have not yet been saved. Reload the page after an edit to see updated
documentation.

TODO: demo of VS Code `Source action > View package documentation`.

Clicking on the source-code link associated with a declaration will
cause your editor to navigate to the declaration.

### `unusedwrite` analyzer

The new
[unusedwrite](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/unusedwrite)
analyzer reports assignments, often to fields of structs, that have no
effect because, for example, the struct is never used again:

```go
func scheme(host string) string {
	u := &url.URL{
		Host:   host, // "unused write to field Host" (no need to construct a URL)
		Scheme: "https:",
	}
	return u.Scheme
}
```

This is at best an indication that the code is unnecessarily complex
(for instance, some dead code could be removed), but often indicates a
bug, as in this example:

```go
type S struct { x int }

func (s S) set(x int) {
	s.x = x // "unused write to field x" (s should be a *S pointer)
}
```


### Hover shows size/offset info

Hovering over the identifier that declares a type or struct field now
displays the size information for the type, and the offset information
for the field. This information may be helpful when making space
optimizations to your data structures, or when reading assembly code.
